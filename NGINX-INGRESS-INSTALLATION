Nginx ingres can be installed in 2 ways. 

1. by adding nginx helm repo to your helm environment and the install nginx
2. by adding helm repo to your helm environment and the search for nginx chartName and
then install.

1. You can install nginx via helm by adding nginx helm repository in your helm environment 
and then update the repo so that it can update to the newest version of the nginx. 
so below 

 https://helm.ngynx.com/stable           is the nginx  helm repo

to add the nginx ingress helm repo, we run

helm add repo <ALIASNAME> https://helm.ngynx.com/stable

Let the aliasaname be nginx

helm add repo nginx https://helm.ngynx.com/stable

helm repo update

helm repo ls

To install

Before you can install, found out the chartname by running

helm search repo aliasaname

if the aliasname is nginx/nginx-ingress

You can install by running

helm install deploymentName chartname

let us call the  deployment name be nginx if we like. you run


helm install nginx nginx/nginx-ingress

2.  The use of helm repo to install nginx

step 1

Add helm repo to your helm environment to be able to install other application using helm chart repo. 

This helm repo by default is below

https://charts.helm.sh/stable

To add the repo to your helm environment, you run

helm add repo aliasName https://charts.helm.sh/stable

Let us called the aliasname webserver. You run

helm add repo webserver https://charts.helm.sh/stable

update the repo by running

helm repo update

To install Nginx Ingress

To install ingress, you need to find the helm chartname for nginx by running

helm search repo webserver 

helm search repo webserver | grep nginx

If it is webserver/nginx-ingress  that came out as the chartName, you can now install nginx 
by running

helm install deploymentName chartName

let us call the deployName to be  nginx

helm install nginx webserver/nginx-ingress

What ever you get as a chartName, you can run the below command to install nginx by running

ANOTHER WAY
You can also deploy nginx ingress by adding nginx helmm repo directly in your helm enrionment 
as below

https://helm.nginx.com/stable

helm repo add nginx https://helm.nginx.com/stable

helm repo add nginx https://helm.nginx.com/stable

helm repo update
