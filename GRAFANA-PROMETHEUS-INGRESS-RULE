Make sure you create a dns records for the grafana HOST in order to be able to acess it externally. Also parsze the correct grafana service name and its service 
port by running

kubectl get svc -o wide

We addded grafana block to prometheus block because prometheus is the data source for grafana becaise if there is no source, grafana would not have any data 
to display in form of graphs
