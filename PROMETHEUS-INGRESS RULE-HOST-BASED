NOTE:

With prometheus ingress host based routing, you have to first of all, you have to know the service port 
number that was assigned to your prometheus components upon installation which you want to use to monitor your applications (microservice applications) 
Example like prometheus alertmanamger, promethus-server, prometheus nodeexporter etc

You can run     

kubectl get svc -o wide

You will see that service port number that was assigned to each components that was installed. We installed

the the prometheus-alertmanger that prof gave us which i forked in my github repo and the file installed
prometheus-alertmanager, prometheus server and others.
