Let us also add prometheus helm-chert repo in our helm environment

prometheus helm-chart repo  is 

https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

To we run

 helm repo add aliasname prometheousRepoUrl

 let us called aliasname prometheus

helm repo add prometheus https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

the run   

helm repo update

Before you can install any 3rd party application using helm, you have to know the chartname of the application in helm. You can achieve this by running

helm search repoName | grep applicationName  

or

helm search repoName | grep applicationComponentName

Prometheus has so many charts or components that can be installed once you run the install command and based on the fact that we use prometheus 
for application performance monitory, we may not need all the components to monitor our server. We may need some of the components.

This is why prof gave us a prometheus-alertmanager file which has been forked in my github.

Let us copy and save the file in our helm environement and name the file  alert.yml

we would have to found the chartname for prometheus  by running

helm search repoName | grep application

reponame was prometheus

helm search repo prometheus | prometheus

If you grow back and forth, you You will see  a chartname called   prometheus/prometheus

chartname = prometheus/prometheus

we can now install or deply prometheus by ruunning

helm install deploymentName chartname -f fileName

let us called the deploy name as apm. it can be any name

helm install apm prometheus/prometheus -f alert.yml

The alertmanager file will install prometheus-alertmanager, prometheus-server and others after you run the above command.
