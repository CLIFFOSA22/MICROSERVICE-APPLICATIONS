Let us also add prometheus helm-chert repo in our helm environment

prometheus helm-chart repo  is 

https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

To we run

 helm repo add aliasname prometheousRepoUrl

 let us called aliasname prometheus

helm repo add prometheus https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

the run   

helm repo update

Before you can install any 3rd party application suing him, you have to know that chartname of the application in helm. You can achieve this by running

helm search repoName | grep applicationName  

or

helm search repoName | grep applicationComponentName

Prometheus has so many charts or components that can be installed once you run the install command and based on the fact that we use prometheus 
for application performance monitory, we may not need all the components to monitor our server. We may need some of the components.

This is why prof gave us a prometheus-alertmanager file which has been forked in my github.

Since we want to install prometheus-alertmanager prof has configured, let us copy and save the file in our helm environement and name the file  alert.yml

we would have to found the chartname for prometheus-alertmanager  by running

helm search repoName | grep applicationComponentName

reponame was prometheus

helm search prometheus | prometheus-alertmanager

You will see  a chartname called   prometheus/prometheus-alertmanager  under  chart

chartname = prometheus/prometheus-alertmanager

we can now install or deply prometheus b y ruunning

helm install deploymentName chartname -f fileName

let us called the deploy name as apm. it can be any name

helm install apm prometheus/prometheus-alertmanager -f alert.yml

The alertmanager file will install prometheus-alertmanager, prometheus-server and others after you run the above command.
